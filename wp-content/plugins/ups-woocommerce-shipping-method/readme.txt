== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin only for Print label and charge the customers a flat rate I set? =
No. The basic version is meant for fetching real time rates. You can use our premium plugin for Print label and charge your own rate for shipping.
= Currently I have not measured or weighed my products. Can I still get rates? =
It is mandatory to put in product weight and dimensions while fetching the rates. =
= My rates are coming as multiples of the item quantity. If I keep 2 items in cart, then the rate is getting doubled? Why is that happening?
The basic version is meant for small shop-owners who have 1 or 2 products in their inventory. Hence packing happens individually. In the premium plugin, there are additional packing methodologies like box packing, weight based packing using which you can get the rates for multiple items without any problems.
= Will your UPS & USPS plugins work smoothly together to have both shipping options available for customer to choose from? =
Yes. You are absolutely right. Both will work mutually exclusive and customer will be presented with both shipping options to choose from. Hope it clarifies.
= I am not getting the rates from the plugin = 
No worries. Just go to plugin settings page, enable the debug option. Once the debug is enabled, go to cart and place an order. In the cart page, you will see the request and response information. Copy them and send it to our support so that we can help you.
= I am not able to tracking my shipments using the plugin? =
Using the basic plugin, it is not possible to track your shipments. The basic plugin is used for fetching rates from the UPS API. Tracking and label generation are available in the our premium plugin.
